![Model Forecast Comparison](sample_27_forecast_dark.png)

## Overview

GlucoseFormer is a time-series Transformer-based model designed to forecast continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) levels. To enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability, the model incorporates:

- **[RoPE (Rotary Positional Encoding)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864)**  
  Improves the modelâ€™s ability to understand time-based relationships by encoding relative position informationâ€”ideal for long context windows.

- **IOB (Insulin on Board)**  
  Simulates the decaying effect of bolus insulin over time, helping the model factor in insulin that is still active in the body.

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**  
  Reduces the dimensionality of input features while preserving critical information, which improves generalization and training speed.

## Dataset

This project uses the publicly available dataset from:

**[The Insulin-Only Bionic Pancreas Pivotal Trial: Testing the iLet in Adults and Children with Type 1 Diabetes](https://public.jaeb.org/datasets/diabetes)**  
Hosted by the JAEB Center for Health Research.

## Data analysis

Key observation #1: The dataset contains continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data collected every 5 minutes for 343 patients. A key observation was the wide variance in the number of glucose readings per patientâ€”ranging from just 122 to over 30,000. This reflects differing durations of participation in the clinical trial.

From this chart, we can see there is a fair amount of diverse data. Still, to avoid potential overfitting to patients with more abundant data, we chose a non-overlapping scheme in processing our sequences.

Key observation #2: Both Basal and Bolus insulin dose amounts and frequency were reported in the dataset as well. To visualize this, we can plot vertical lines over every bolus/basal event
