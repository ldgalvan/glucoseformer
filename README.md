# GlucoseFormer 📈

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on **glucose forecasting** using a full **end-to-end machine learning pipeline**, covering all key stages of the ML lifecycle:

- 🔄 [Data Preprocessing](/process_and_train) using **PySpark**
- 🧠 [Model Training](/process_and_train/train_glucformer_cpu.py) with **PyTorch**
- 🌐 [Model Deployment](/prediction_example) via **FastAPI** on **AWS ECS**

Trained model weights can be found in the [`weights`](weights) directory.

The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience across the **entire ML lifecycle**, from raw data to production deployment.  
**Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!**


In this study we introduce GlucoseFormer, a time-series Transformer-based model designed to forecast continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) levels. There are 3 key modifications we explore:

- **[RoPE (Rotary Positional Encoding)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864)**  
  Improves the model’s ability to understand time-based relationships by encoding relative position information.

- **IOB (Insulin on Board)**  
  Simulates the decaying effect of bolus insulin over time, helping the model factor in insulin that is still active in the body.

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**  
  Reduces the dimensionality of input features while preserving critical information, which improves generalization and training speed.

We train 5 variants of the vanilla transformer model on 3 different context lengths (2.5 hr, 5hr, and 10hr).

## Dataset

This project uses the publicly available dataset:

**[The Insulin-Only Bionic Pancreas Pivotal Trial: Testing the iLet in Adults and Children with Type 1 Diabetes](https://public.jaeb.org/datasets/diabetes)**  
Hosted by the JAEB Center for Health Research.

## Data analysis

The dataset includes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data recorded every 5 minutes for a cohort of 343 patients. One of the most notable characteristics is the wide variability in the number of CGM readings per patient, ranging from just 122 to over 28,000 entries. This variance reflects the differing durations of patient participation in the clinical trial.

To better understand this distribution, we visualize the number of CGM measurements per patient below:  
![CGM data](images/patient_counts_distribution.png)

This distribution reveals a diverse set of data points across patients. However, to mitigate the risk of overfitting to patients with disproportionately large data volumes, we adopted a non-overlapping window strategy when constructing model input sequences.

In addition to glucose measurements, the dataset also includes detailed records of Basal and Bolus insulin deliveries—both in terms of dosage and frequency. To visualize these clinical interventions, we plot vertical markers over time, corresponding to each insulin delivery event in a sample patient’s timeline.

## Feature Engineering

With frequent bolus injections happening, we introduce a new variable which incorporated the decay rate of Insulin on Board (IOB). 

![Bolus](images/bolus_decay.png)

This helps our time-series transformer learn to account for decaying bolus insulin that's still in the body. Here's an example of how this new variable behaves compared to CGM readings:

## Dimensionality Reduction

To manage the complexity of high-dimensional input data, we apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the input feature space to either 2 or 3 principal components. This helps improve generalization and training efficiency without significant loss of information.

## Data Processing

We use this [script](process_data.py) to process our data into different lengths. Here's an example of one of our splits, where a 5 hour context window was used to create 4 sequences.

![Split](images/sequence_split_visual.png)

One consideration to make is, as we vary our context length (2.5hr, 5hr, 10hr), the amount of training sequences changes. Below is a table of our splits:

| Context Window | Train Sequences | Val Sequences | Test Sequences |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 2.5 hours      | 63,525           | 7,940          | 7,942           |
| 5 hours        | 28,514           | 3,564          | 3,565           |
| 10 hours       | 6,909            | 863            | 865             |

This allows us to understand the requirements for data and number of parameters for our model.

## Model Training

Loss function: We chose Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as our primary loss metric. In this context—predicting CGM values—using Mean Squared Error (MSE) felt unnecessarily harsh due to its tendency to heavily penalize outliers. Exploring alternative loss functions tailored to the clinical or temporal sensitivity of glucose prediction remains a promising direction for future work.

For consistency, we used the same sized 3.1 million parameter transformer for each experiment. There was consideration of increasing our MLP layer dimensions as we add IOB or more data, but this was outside the scope of our study. 

| Parameter         | Value | Description                                         |
|-------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `input_size`      | 4     | Number of input features (e.g., CGM, basal, bolus, IOB) |
| `d_model`         | 256   | Embedding dimension for each token                 |
| `nhead`           | 8     | Number of attention heads                          |
| `num_layers`      | 4     | Number of Transformer encoder layers               |
| `dim_feedforward` | 1024  | Hidden size of the MLP (position-wise feedforward) |
| `dropout`         | 0.2   | Dropout probability used across layers             |

Here's the train/val losses for each model:

![Loss 2.5hr](images/train_val_loss_2_5hr_side_by_side.png)  
![Loss 5hr](images/train_val_loss_5hr_side_by_side.png)  
![Loss 10hr](images/train_val_loss_10hr_side_by_side.png)

Analysis: The 10-hour context window setup suffers from limited data availability, which constrains the model’s ability to minimize loss during training. In contrast, the 5-hour and 2.5-hour configurations benefit from denser data coverage, enabling better learning performance.

## Results

Overview: It was insightful to observe how different model variants performed in terms of percentage error. The best-performing models were those using the 5-hour input window, which provided 28,500 training sequences, striking an effective balance between inference speed and prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion and Future Improvements

Forecasting continuous glucose monitor (CGM) values over time is a critical challenge in modern healthcare. In this project, we explored the feasibility of using transformer-based models with approximately 3.1 million parameters, along with feature extraction and dimensionality reduction techniques, to predict CGM trends.

### Future Directions

- **Predicting hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia events**  
  These events can have severe or even life-threatening consequences. Accurately forecasting them could help inform patients in advance and enable timely intervention.

- **Personalized modeling with extended context**  
  Future work could involve training models on a larger context window tailored to individual patients, rather than aggregating data from many individuals.

- **Incorporating additional physiological features**  
  Including signals like basal insulin decay and other relevant biomarkers could improve model robustness and clinical relevance.

### ☁️ Cloud Deployment

To test cloud deployment, I chose **AWS** as the provider and deployed the model using **ECS Fargate**. The model was wrapped in a **FastAPI** application, containerized with **Docker**, and pushed to **Amazon ECR**.

I implemented the ability to feed custom sequences in for prediction, as is indicated by the -F flag.

```bash
texasgoat@DESKTOP-OMI6RTO:curl -X POST http://<aws_task_ip>:8000/predict \
     -F "file=@one_sequence.npy"

{"predicted_cgm":[234.2991485595703,234.72262573242188,234.8809051513672,235.13677978515625,235.8567352294922,237.21424865722656,236.97845458984375,234.7597198486328,231.78501892089844,227.13497924804688,215.05245971679688,211.31585693359375]}
